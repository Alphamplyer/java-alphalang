# Java alphalang

Java alphalang is just a modified version of this [guide](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com)

## Goal
Training to understand how things works and maybe :
- take it to the next level by compiling it in x86 arch. machine code.
- working on a well known programming language to extend it.
- have fun creating my own language in the future.
