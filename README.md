# Java alphalang

Java alphalang is just a modified version of this [guide](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com)

## Goal
Training to understand how things works and maybe :
- take it to the next level by compiling it in x86 arch. machine code.
- working on a well known programming language to extend it.
- have fun creating my own language in the future.


## Implemented Features

- [x] Arithmetic calculation
- [x] File and prompt input
- [x] Statements
- [x] Variable declaration
- [x] Variable assignment
- [x] Scoping
- [ ] Control flow (if, for, while, ...)
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Java is slow, rewriting in c:
  - [ ] change frontend (Parser -> Compiler) 
  - [ ] change representation (Syntax tree -> Bytecode)
  - [ ] change execution method (creating VM based on the previous interpreter)
